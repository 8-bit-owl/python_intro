## Who Are They For?

The notes are self-contained but fairly terse, and are intended for someone versed in other programming languages and who is seeking to learn the syntax, style and peculiarities of Python.  So, given some programming background, they can be followed without using the book.  

The notes are also only a very basic introduction to Python and not comprehensive.  After completing them you should be comfortable programming basic capabililties in Python.  Once you are at that level, it is fairly simple to learn new features to solve a given problem through a Google or StackOverflow search.  

If, on the other hand, you are new to programming, then these notes may be too terse, and it would be preferable to follow the book or do an [online tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
