## These Notes:
These notes follow the chapters in the book, and highlight key points.  If you are already familiar with Python or similar languages, you can review the material quicker using these notes.  But if you have not had much experience programming, then following the book is preferable, although you may wish to use VSCode, as explained below.

## Learning Python
To learn Python with these notes, it is best try all the examples yourself.  Don't cut and paste the commands.  Instead, type them in to the Python command line *yourself*.  This act of typing is integral to learning how to program.  The best way to learn programming concepts is to **use them** after you hear or see them. 

## Operating System

Python is available on most operating systems (OSes).  These notes will assume Windows, but it should not be hard to use the notes with a different OS.

## Integrated Developer Environment (IDE)
The book uses the IDE that comes with Python called IDLE. These notes, on the other hand, use VSCode.  VSCode is free, open-source, cross-platform, extremely powerful, and surprisingly easy to use.  It provides powerful editing and debugging functions for Python. It also has extensions for many other applications.  For instance, I am writing these notes in VSCode in Markdown with an editor that provides a preview of the output.  If you wish, you can read these notes and run an interactive terminal all in VSCode.
