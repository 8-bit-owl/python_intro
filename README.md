## Who Are They For?

The notes are fairly terse, and are intended for someone well-versed in other programming languages and who is seeking to learn the syntax, style and peculiarities of Python.  The notes are also only an introduction and not comprehensive.  After completing them you should be comfortable programming basic capabililties in Python.  Once you are at that level, it is usually fairly simple to learn new features to solve a given problem through a Google or StackOverflow search.  

If, on the other hand, you are new to programming, then these notes may be too terse, and it would be preferable to follow the book or do an [online tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).  If you do that, you may still find the discussion on VSCode in these notes useful.
