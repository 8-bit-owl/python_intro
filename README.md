## Who Are These Notes For?

The notes are self-contained but fairly terse, and are intended for someone versed in other programming languages to quickly learn the syntax, style and peculiarities of Python.  Hence, given some programming background, they can be followed without using the book.  

The notes only attempt a basic introduction to Python and are not comprehensive.  After completing them you should be comfortable programming basic capabililties in Python.  Once you are at that level, it is fairly simple to learn new features through a web or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) search.  

If, on the other hand, you are new to programming, then these notes may be too terse, and it would be preferable to follow the book or do an [online tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
