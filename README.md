## These Notes:
These notes follow the chapters in the book, and highlight key points.  If you are already familiar with Python or similar languages, you can review the material quicker with these notes.  

## Learning Python
To learn Python with these notes, it is best try all the examples yourself.  Don't cut and paste the commands.  Instead, type them in to the Python command line *yourself*.  This act of typing is integral to learning how to program.

## Integrated Developer Environment
On difference between the notes and the book, is that the notes use VSCode, rather than the IDLE, for an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment).  VSCode is free, open-source, cross-platform, extremely powerful, and surprisingly easy to use.  It provides powerful editing and debugging functions for Python and is available here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

VSCode has extensions for many varied applications.  For instance, I am writing these notes in VSCode in Markdown with an editor that provides a preview of the output.
