    "This chapter gives instructions for installing Python and Visual Studio Code on a Windows PC.  If you are reviewing Python for ECE-CSE 434, you can use Python and VSCode that are preinstalled for Ubuntu in the VDI Remote Desktop.\n",

    "\n",
    "While you can download and install the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/), a simpler way in Windows is to type `python` from the command line.  This will take you to the Windows store and prompt to you download and install Python, which you can do.\n",
